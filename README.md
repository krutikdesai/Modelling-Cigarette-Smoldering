# Modelling-Cigarette-Smoldering
This project aims to implement a 1D model of combustion processes during smoldering, the process of slow and flameless combustion that occurs when a cigarette is set alight. 
The project files includes instances of the solver for two types of cigarettes: **Burley** and **Flue-cured**. The modelling of the Burley cigarette has been done with two methods outlined in papers by **Chen (2002)** and **Muramatsu (1979)**.

Some errors in the equations in the original papers are corrected and specified in the project report.
